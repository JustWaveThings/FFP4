            //        An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.

            // In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

            // For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.

            // Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.

            // For n = 10 the result will be 2, 3, 5, 7.

            //         P.S.The code should work for any n, not be hard - tuned for any fixed value.
